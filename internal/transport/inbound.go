// implements InboundTransport.Receive: it authenticates the webhook, stages
// the raw MIME to a bounded temp file, and returns both the normalized message
// and the explicit account/domain/credential binding it verified. The mailbox
// core downstream (recipient resolution, MIME parsing, CommitInbound, event
// publishing) is transport-agnostic.
